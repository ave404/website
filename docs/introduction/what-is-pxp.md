# What is PXP?

PXP is a superset of [PHP](https://php.net) that improves upon the language by providing additional syntax and runtime features. 

Your PXP code gets transpiled into vanilla PHP ahead-of-time much like tooling found in the JavaScript ecosystem.

Since PXP is a _superset_ of PHP, all of your existing PHP code will continue to work. You can change the file extension to `.pxp` and start using PXP specific features right away!
